What is the origin of the 1% Internet rule? Basically there is a good rule of thumb that has been reported and I have also observed that, in things like a wiki, only 1% create new content and 9% edit content and the greater 90% just view content. [^1] Where does this rule come from? Is it something intrinsic to human motivation?

There seems to be a consensus towards the proportions of people associated with different levels of effort. Basically I see the 1% rule like this - there may be different levels of effort (do nothing, do a very small thing, do something big). These happen to be easily quantized on the internet in particular. When you surf the web you can always "do nothing". Anything else requires a click or typing. Clicking is a very small thing, and typing is something that is very big. Of course there is more to it than that - creating content takes much more effort.

But why is it always divided by 90-9-1?
