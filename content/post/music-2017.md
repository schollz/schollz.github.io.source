I have been using *Spotify Discovery Weekly* playlists, *Sound Opinions* podcast, and the *NPR All Songs Considered* podcast to discover all sorts of great music.

**Orchestral Variations** by *Minor Victories*

From what I understand, this is a symphonic cover album of a indie rock album. I've listened to the rock album a little and I can't understand why this orchestral version is so much better.

**Men I Trust** by *Men I Trust*

This keeps getting suggested to me, and with good reason. Its a great indie pop album.

**EP** by *Joon Moon*

Joon Moon is one of my favorite new bands. The ensemble is simple - piano, drums and vocals. But each is absolutely amazing on its own.


**There and Back** by *Tangerine*

This is like a modern-day Simon and Garfunkle, with a little bit of Bob Dylan.

**A Deeper Understanding** by *The War On Drugs*

Probably my favorite band right now, and with a new album which somehow is almost better than the last.

**If You See Me, Say Yes** by *Flock of Dimes*

A great album to listen to front to back.

**Cave** by *Future Islands*

This album will always remind me of Canada, since I listened to pieces of it while driving through. 

**Silence** by *Tom Adams*

A discovery from *All Songs Considered* which is a very mellow and soothing album.
