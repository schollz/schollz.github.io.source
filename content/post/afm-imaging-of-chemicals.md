Unraveling the Molecular Structures of Asphaltenes by Atomic Force Microscopy

Petroleum (about)
composed of over 100,000 distint chemical compounds. (1)
Unwanted asphaltene phase transitions hinder petroleum production, transportation, and refining
The primary unresolved component of crude oil is asphaltene.(2-4) Understanding the structure of asphaltenes is of immense economic importance(2, 4-8) and a prerequisite to establishing the structureâ€“function relationship in petroleomics
