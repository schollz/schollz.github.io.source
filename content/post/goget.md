This is a little hack to use shallow clones for new git checkouts with `go get`. Unfortunately for Gophers, [this has been an open issue for three years counting](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/13078) without a workable solution aside from patching the go toolchain yourself. This solution utilizes a *git* wrapper that determines if a pull/clone is happening and then makes sure it is shallow. 

The wrapper is only a few lines of code, here's the `main.go`:

```go
package main

import (
    "os"
    "os/exec"
)

func main() {
    args := os.Args
    if len(args) > 1 {
        if args[1] == "pull" {
            args = append(args[:2], append([]string{"--depth=1"}, args[2:]...)...)
        } else if args[1] == "clone" {
            args = append(args[:2], append([]string{"--depth=1", "--shallow-submodules", "--single-branch"}, args[2:]...)...)
        }
    }
    args[0] = "/usr/bin/git"
    cmd := exec.Command(args[0])
    if len(args) > 0 {
        cmd = exec.Command(args[0], args[1:]...)
    }
    cmd.Stdout = os.Stdout
    cmd.Stderr = os.Stderr
    err := cmd.Run()
    if err != nil {
        os.Exit(1)
    }
}
```

To make it easy, I've saved this code as `main.go` in a repo named `git` ([schollz/git](https://github.com/schollz/git)). The repo is named "`git`" on purpose so that your GOPATH can be prepended to the PATH and then the wrapper can be substituted for the real `git` (`/usr/bin/git`). So then, to activate shallow cloning all you have to do is: 

```
$ go get github.com/schollz/git
$ export PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH
```

which you can add to your `.bashrc` files if you want it to be permanent. This way, the wrapper will aways be used and the wrapper will force cloning to be shallow.

## Benchmarks

Here's a benchmark showing a 50% reduction in disk usage and thus a 50% reduction in time taken for a `go get`. You'll not get that much for smaller repositories, but its not bad.

### normal `go get`


```
% docker run -it golang:1.10 /bin/bash
root@d9208178f1fa:/go# time go get github.com/juju/juju/...
real    7m35.631s
user    1m40.059s
sys     0m45.436s
root@d9208178f1fa:/go# du -sh .
1.1G
```

### shallow `go get`

```
% docker run -it golang:1.10 /bin/bash
root@68135fb64a3e:/go# go get github.com/schollz/git
root@68135fb64a3e:/go# export PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH
root@68135fb64a3e:/go# time go get github.com/juju/juju/...
real    3m0.335s
user    0m29.192s
sys     0m17.253s
root@d9208178f1fa:/go# du -sh .
499M    .
```
