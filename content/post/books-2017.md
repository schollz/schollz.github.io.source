I've read about 15 books this year - not as many as I'd like ([I read 40
in college](/books-2008)), but I did a lot of magazine reading too (e.g.
*The Sun* and *The New Yorker*). The books that I read can be classified
into three major categories: *non-fictional animal encounters*, *magical
horror realism* and *fictional non-fiction.*

The first main category are books I read in 2017 are about *non-fictional animal encounters*. My favorite book in this category, and of 2017 overall, is **Illumination in the Flat-woods** by *Joe Hutto*. Its the real-like story of an experiment to raise turkey's through their entire life.
I never knew how amazing turkeys were until I read
this book. There is a movie by the same name that also is amazing, as they
were able to recapitulate a lot which occurred in the book (i.e. replicating the experiment). I can say, for
sure, that I think turkeys are amazing now. I will still eat turkey, but
now with a reverence I never had before.

I started out the year reading **What a Fish Knows** by *Jonathan
Balcombe*. I didn't quite finish this book - the first chapters a good but
it turns into a bit of a direct plea to save the fish instead of an
account of how amazing they are. An animal book shouldn't need to make
a direct plea
- the book should show enough how amazing the animals are and the reader
can decide for themselves, and its a hard decision to make if you learn
how awesome some of these animals are. 





Another good example of animal writing is **Last Chance to See** by
*Douglas Adams* is an interesting investigation of animals near
extinction, circa
1985. A lot of the animals in the book have since recovered, except the
Baiji dolphin, unfortunately. Despite the severe topic, its a funny and
entertaining book. Adams is a funny person and he gives some levity to
some of the dark topics. He is also a great everyman in the book who has
lots of things explained to him in a simple way - so its easy to pick up
information.


![Every week I run in Elk Island to see Bison](/img/bisons.jpg)

I've been going out to see Bison every week now. I live in Edmonton, so
I'm not far from Elk Island where there is a ton of wildish bison roaming
around. I've literally run into them on the trail. Anyways, they are quite
impressive animals, and I wanted to learn more about them. I found a great
book, **American Bison** by *Steven Rinella*, which goes into their
history. A lot of the focus is on hunting, but hunting in a humane way
which is really interesting to learn about. Its a very respectful book
about the bison with lots of great information.
 

The next major category of book that I really enjoyed are books about
*magical horror realism*. I didn't realize this was a genre, but once
I found it I realized it was something that I really enjoyed. **Library at
Mount Char** by *Scott Hawkins* is my second-favorite book of
2017. The premise is bizarre, but the books twists in a much more bizarre
      way than imaginable. This book is to fantasy what The Matrix is to
      science fiction.


Another thrilling book I read was **Weaveworld** by *Clive Barker*, an
epic tale that goes back and forth between reality and fantasy until they
merge at the end. Great read. I actually found the previous book after
reading this book and trying to find another book that matched it, to
which I wrote [an entire
program](https://rpiai.com/why-i-made-a-book-recommendation-service/)
which ended up becoming a website for people:
[booksuggestions.ninja](https://www.booksuggestions.ninja).

The third major category that I greatly enjoyed is of *ficiontal
non-fiction.* The first book I read of 2017 was **Pieces of the Left
Hand** by *J. Robert Lennon* and it is a little work of genius. They are
a collection of very, very short tales of a seemingly non-fictional
account of the author's life. The stories of very mundane things - stories
about the locals smashing mailboxes and dinner parties. Except they
inexplicably almost always take a weird and unbelievable end.

I have a soft spot for nonconformist writers like Bukowski and Hunter
Thompson. I found **Gonzo Girl** by *Cheryl Della Pietra* to be an
extraordinary fictional account of an assistant to Hunter Thompson. A lot
of it delves into tropes about genius (drug addition is a trope that it
seems to try to destroy) and sexism (which the author herself constantly
proclaims and then falls right into). Still, the writing is very good.

**Imaginary Imagnitude** by *Stainslaw Lem* is a wholly amazing book
- from the philosophy of a self-aware computer system to the prologues of
books that have never existed (like a book about bacteria that
communicate). A lot of the Polish wordplay is lost in English, but it is
still funny nevertheless.

Towards the end of the year I read **The Three-Body Problem** by *Liu Cixin* which I saw was recommended by former president Barack Obama. It gladdens my heart that this book in particular was recommended by Obama - its about the looming destruction of Earth by an Alien race which undermines humans by attempting to destroy their progress in *basic science*. The importance of basic science in this book makes me think that Obama may have had similar sentiments. Anways, the book is great - its translated well from Chinese and has lots of great information about the Chinese revolution and communism. The science explainations are not bad either.

## Epistemological articles

One author has been sticking out to me this year
- *Kathryn Schultz*. Whenever I read her articles I instantly realize its
her - she has an amazing knack for taking any kind of thesis and detailing
a complete and thoughtful story around it. She seems to like to take
strange thesis too. The first one I read was on [Henry Thoreau as
a hypocrite](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/10/19/pond-scum) (of
which I totally disagree but love the writing). My favorite from this year
were **[How to be
a know-it-all](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/16/how-to-be-a-know-it-all)**
which posits that its easy to learn a little bit about everything and
**[Fantastic beasts and how to rank
them](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/11/06/is-bigfoot-likelier-than-the-loch-ness-monster)**
which tries to understand why its possible to make judgements about things
that don't exist.
