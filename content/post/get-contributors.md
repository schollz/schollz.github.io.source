Open-source code invites the possibility for others to help your (or hurt you).
There are some things I've found that you should do and should *not* do if
you are trying to get new contributors. The expertise I have comes from
having great experiences as a maintainer and as a contributor, as well as
horrible experiences as a maintainer and as a contributor.
