Is it possible to write a novel that can be read, paragraph by paragraph, backwards and forwards? The exact content could be different (so not exactly a palindrome), but I wonder if you could still have a meaningful experience when reading both ways.

The only thing I know that might be similar is *Hopscotch* by *Julio Cortázra*[^1], which I haven't read but looks interesting.
