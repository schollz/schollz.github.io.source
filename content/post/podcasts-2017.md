I've spent days sitting in a dark room looking into a microscope. Lots of
the time I listen to music, but I've started to listen to podcasts. I've
found a lot of great podcasts out there. I think my number one category of
podcast is “*the podcast about the small things*.” Its always
a welcome relief from the mainstream media which focuses more on the
hyperbole of small things. I do like some news, but I've found some great
podcasts that pitch the news in a more informal and friendly way. These
are my favorite podcasts discovered this year, I hope I continue to
discover new ones.


The basic premise of *the podcast about the small things* is always to find
some small thing that no one thinks about and talk about it for 20-30
minutes and often interview the main players involved in the production
of the Small Things. I think the major bastion of this type of podcast is
**[99% invisible](https://99percentinvisible.org/)**, which is devoted to
illuminating *"all the thought that goes into the things we don’t think
about."*

There seems to be a cottage industry for these types of podcasts, and
I love them all. There is **[Every Little
Thing](https://gimletmedia.com/every-little-thing/)** which is *"a show
about the small stuff."* There is **[Revisionist
History](http://revisionisthistory.com/about)** which is Malcom Gladwell's
show about *"Something overlooked. Something misunderstood."* but mostly
its just small things that Mr. Gladwell finds fascinating. There is
**[Undiscovered](http://www.undiscoveredpodcast.org/)** which is a podcast
*"about the all the stuff that gets left out of journal articles,"* and
while nominally science-based it often seeks out big stories from small
things. There is **[Twenty Thousand Hertz](https://www.20k.org/)** which
is more sound-based but still aims to fill the divide because *"you may
not think about the sounds you hear every day."* There is
**[Invisibilia](http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510307/invisibilia)** which
*"is about the invisiable forces that control human behavior"* and then
there is **[Surprisingly
Awesome](https://gimletmedia.com/surprisingly-awesome/)** which attempts
to find fascination in the world even though *"lots of things in the world
seem ordinary."* For a more food-related one there is **[The Fridge
Light](http://www.cbc.ca/mediacentre/program/the-fridge-light)** which
looks at *"the hidden stories of the things we eat."* Another food one is
**[Why We Eat What We
Eat](http://creative.gimletmedia.com/show/why-we-eat-what-we-eat/about/)**
which *"investigates the unseen forces that shape our eatings habits.*"
Though its not around anymore, I loved listening to **[Mystery
Show](https://gimletmedia.com/mystery-show/)** that simply *"solves
a minor mystery which cannot be solved with search engines."*





My other favorite podcasts are the news ones that are toned as if you were having a beer with the podcasters. They still relay information, but in a way that is so informal you barely realize that they are relaying some information that they spent their week learning. For politics, there is **[NPR politics](http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510310/npr-politics-podcast)** and often (nowadays) **[This American Life](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/podcast)**, for art there is **[A Piece of Work](https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/3860)**, for science there is **[Science Vs.](https://gimletmedia.com/science-vs/)**, and for music there is **[All Songs Considered](http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510019/all-songs-considered)** and for culture there is **[Pop Culture Happy Hour](http://www.npr.org/sections/monkeysee/129472378/pop-culture-happy-hour/)**. I love these podcasts, but I have to pace myself with them because the constant loose informality of the tone can become disingenuous and grating after awhile.



I have some favorite podcasts that are just funny or amusing to me, and
not entirely educational. These would include **[Why oh
why](http://www.whyohwhyradio.com/)** which accounts for dating in the
real world (though sometimes fictionally). Another great one is
**[Beautiful
Anonymous](http://www.earwolf.com/show/beautiful-anonymous/)** which is
sometimes about dating, but it is mostly about the real world. Then there
is just the improve humor of **[My Brother My Brother and
Me](http://www.maximumfun.org/shows/my-brother-my-brother-and-me)** which
I enjoy just to hear people crack themselves up.
