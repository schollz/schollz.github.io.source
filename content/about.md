My name is Zack and I am an academic scientist and programmer. 

This site has my notes on interesting recent [science](/tags/science) and my adventures in [coding](/tags/coding) and [art](/tags/art) (which often overlap).

I've made other sites, including

[my academic page](https://zackaryscholl.com/),
[my smart Raspberry Pi projects](https://rpiai.com),
